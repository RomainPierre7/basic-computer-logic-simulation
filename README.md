# basic-computer-logic-simulation

This is a simple computer logic simulation. It includes logic gates, processor registers, and adders. All the components are implemented using Python classes and generalized to any bit size architecture.

## How to run
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Logic gates

### Main gates
- NOT
- AND
- OR

### Derived gates
- NAND
- NOR
- XOR
- XNOR
